4,i ordered this cable to connect my phone to android auto of car the cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made i already has a micro usb cable from ambrane and its still in good shape i connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues i also connected it to the charging port and yes it has fast charging supportit quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didnt ever thought that this cable will be so long its good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast chargingvalue for money with extra lengthgood working fineproduct quality is goodgoodvery goodbought for my daughters old phonebrand new cable it was not charging i already repacked and requested for replacementi checked again and there was some green colour pastefungus inside the micro usb connector i cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working againchecked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma1500ma not bad came with braided 15m long cable pretty impressive for the pricecant blame the manufacturerbut quality issues by the distributor they might have stored in very humid place
4,worked on iphone 7 and didnt work on iphone xrhttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesi71qffalv9zlsy88jpglookwise i didnt like it still i use it for my workproduct is quite good and is fast chargingloved iti like it looks last longthe sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use but its speed of charging is great very good product for the average income groupits great for charging devices with various types of ports but works best when charging one device at a timegood item
4,the product seems and works good but its not a fast charging cable as it has to be and when all the three ports are connected its more slower im charging only good is single cable all three ports are there so its a ok product only if yiu are looking for fast charging then i would say think twice before you buyi have been using foe a while now this is for sure not a fast charging cable and in this tge lightning charger is not working properly every now and then i have to check its it charging my iphone and i had to unplug and reply for charging its getting disconnected i dont understand how so this cable is no oki used this type c most commonly depending on my devices power wats and also etcnice chargercharging is bit slow when u connect multiple devicescannot transfer dataonly charging purposeso nice colour cheap and bestthe cable looks decent with charging but not fit for me as it does not support apple car play
4,the cable build quality is good for normal charging its great cable but doesnt support quick chargingworks for charging but other applications are hit or missexample my external keyboard doesnt work with itbest quality and length of wire was qute good and durability also good the cable is awesome and no charging issue till now because it is a braided cable chance of it damage are very less overall i like the product using this cable from past 40 days to charge lg g7thinq and samsung s21fe so far supergoodseems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough base of the pin is too thick that i couldnt insert it into my phones charging port without removing the caseover all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin 99 me 15m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai agar 150 me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai
4,it does the job really well no complaints regarding the charging power at a price of rs 199 it is worth every buck although this cable is a bit shorter than the original one but the original oneplus cable is around rs900 so there is a huge price difference and it does the same job as the original oneuseful for c type charging but not suitable with all adapters or usb points serves the purposesturdily built does its job well charged my samsung galaxy m51 quicker than the original cable hope it stays the same going aheadliked the charging speed disliked the length on ipads this is awesome but its is not 6 foot long so this the only point to think otherwise it is the best cablegoodeverything is good including connectivity and stuffnice productim using this for my carthis product is nice and worth the amounti recommend it to anyone who are looking for this kind of cable
4,i am writing this review after 2 months the first cable had a cut and had to be replaced the second cable is working fine no issues using it to charge me ps3 controller works fine at a good price planning to pick up another one as a spareproduct oki bought this cable to charge my 10w bluetooth speaker and its working as expectedits lengthy and usable for car dashcamquality is average and micro type b end does sit very tightotherwise its all goodbut keep checking price of amazon basics cable of this type price drops many times thats better qualitythis is one of the good product in this price range quality is okayusing it for my laptop cooling pad overall build looks sturdy but longevity cannot confirm also you cannot connect 2 pcs using a male to male usb that is not how it works stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was not intended forcan confirm that it is 12m as most other products and not 15m as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the productno review mentions this but i needed a 15m length for perfect use so disappointed as i have to rotate the cooling pad and use it cable falls short by around 15cmit works well the cable is soft and flexible in all probability it will last long alsobut pover quality
4,liked the product accurate to my usb apparatusgood valuetill now i had purchased about 20 cables both micro and c type for myself and my family in this last one year its all because this brand wins my trust by provinding great quality with reasonable pricenatested with 24 amps charger and phone gives full 24 amps power to phonethe cable looks thick and it has nice texture despite that i am sure it is not very durable the usb connectors are extremely sturdy and they dont bend or flex the wire will break before the connector doeswarning usb micro connector has a strong hook be careful while plugging and unplugging or you may damage your devicevery cheap and usable cable for 120 rssuper powernice productin this price this is the best one
4,everything is fine but it is bulky and hard it should be softer and thinnerthank you amazon very good charging cable goodgood onequality is good worth for 150200 short but durablevery good product satisfiedthis is fast charging c pin usbyou can purchase itnice product at price of below 100
4,works well on my 4k amazone fire tv stick as well as 2nd generation fire tv stickif your original remote is got damaged buy this one but price is a bit high should have been available for rs 800liked it and and it suited very well for my fire tvthe representative are very friendly and supportiveproduct was good customer service was also goodit been a month since i started using this product the product is good but it lags a lot it was the same before but i thought since it is new over time this would get resolved but its still the same it takes time to perform an action most of the times it not up to the expectation that is the reason why i am changing the review thanksit works with fire stick lite and to my surprise volume controls are also working which was missing in the original one setup is also quickworking as expected support is promptthis remote is good as expected shared manual is very simple to follow i am happy with this product

4,4 i bought it formy samsung e4000 series led tv the remote works i use it mostly to control volume and source and it does its work am happy with itat first they had delivered one remote that didnt work and then i got a replacement which works as expected thank yougreat its a replica of my old samsung remote i have used it for a month now and no issues good productworks fine with my samsung smart tv no issues till nowdoes everything the original remote doesnot a genuine product seems brittle and a little tough around the edges lighter than original remote probably due to the poorer quality of plastic but for my usage thats ok as there are no kids to damage it i barely use 24 buttons in the entire remote source switch to hdmi for chromecast volume buttons play and pauseit works even with older 40 inch samsung 3d tv with smart remote one
4,the color is not same as what is shown in images rest the quality is goodgo for it it is useful and strong also but buy in sale or discounted price onlybest for daily use bit be alert from delivery man of dtdc of amazon even they are ready for anything like gundasusing from several months very good product if you want to avoid the cable this is a best producteco dot 3rdproduct does its work but quality can be improved edges are not smooth and is made of poor quality plastic no shine but dull outlook still ok to buy in this pricethe product correctly holds the echo dot as well as the cables without hindering the flat placement on the wall the position of the holder can be shifted slightly as well in terms of distance from the wall because the holder can slide on the adapter these are the biggest pros for the product as for the cons the product could improve on the plastic quality and texturequality need to improve but not bad happy to purchaseif your power outlet is not going to hold the charger stronger dont go for it it might fall down
4,the build quality is good not sure on the reliability front lets see in few months the sound quality is satisfactory there is a reduction in sound which is expected during conversion anyway but considering the price its negligible overall a good buy will recommend this one especially for tvs without optical out and just coaxspdif outhow relace it with warrantyfor converting digital audio of sony bravia xr55x90j 4k uhd to sony davdz150kanalogue with rl sound ouputfirst device did not work may be my errorreplacement device is excellentit is giving me virtual 51 effect while watching movies on disney hot star and amezon primemy 15cyears old dav dz150k home theaterwithout any digital output is giving perfe ct virtual 51 effect on pcm audioreplacement device was delivered by amezon injust two days timeexcellent service by amezonthanks also to u tube from where i learned my lessons of installing this classic devicei was very disappointed on 1st device and as there is no return policy i asked for replacement and it worked very welland now i am very happy and would like to recommend to people who have new tv without any analog output and has only digital and hdmi output and old home theater systems with only analogcomponent or composit outputthank you amezon for this diwali giftdoesnt provides surround soundvery nice product i am using it last few months sound quality is very goodgoodsoooo nicegood

4,quality is good strong build supports fast charging rates some people may find the led really bright especially in the dark and it cannot be turned off the port itself can be a bit loose but it can be used with cases are a bit thickjust check if your smartphone has earphone jack beside the charging port in which case you might not be able to use both togetherhappy with the productgoodgood onemore time tekennice worth itgood qualitygood product thanks amazon

4,quality is good but received the damaged product was expecting the item but when the delivery got late i had to understand unfortunately the product is of no good to me this item was glued at the edgesgood but fits loose at top bit tight at bottom but still can go with the purchasethis fits the samsung smart tv remote perfectly all edges are covered too so if you do drop you remote from a decent height it will not let the remote get scratched or cracked but you cant expect it to save you from all kinds of dropsi believe i needed it because my kid keeps dropping the remote and i was worried because the samsung smart remote is quite expensive it even fits the slightly tilted shape of the remote quite perfectlyproduct is good as described and fitted perfectly very smoothly thanks amazona good product in a higher price sideaverage ok ok qualityfit can be better as side portions are loose and might reduce overall covers life as kids put finger and small items into it however the top and lower portions are tight enough to meet the purpose luminous blue gives a decent glow when its in pitch dark
4,the biggest issue with buying an accessory for an apple product from a nonapple supplier is you will never know if this will work this products is working i used it an old ipod touch i am able to charge and transfer data i hope the product has good shelflife as well value for moneyafter a bad experience with fastx charging cable for ipad i was apprehensive to buy any such thing online but then i decided to try once more with amketteto my delight the cable fitted the port and started charging the ipad charging is slower than the original apple cable but it will do if youre not a heavy usergood value for money i hope it works for more than 6 months at leasti loose the hope to revive my iphone4 i found in some old items old cable was damaged and not able to charge it i ordered the cable just to check if my old iphone can revive even after almost 78 years without charging got the cable on time and the quality of packing and cable look impressive and to my surprize my phone got charged and started working i am thankful the cable helped me to revive my old phoneworking with ipod perfectlynot a good productfits well 100 fast charging great productmy ipad 2 become live againvery good condition and its useful for me
4,good projector for this price rangenice picture quality stylish design and finishing also good but low audio volumeits better to use extra speakersgood quality for the priceit was amazing to see it in big picture at home and the pixel projector was rocking but one thing we can enjoy the big picture well in minimal or no lightthe projector is soo good for a small home theatre the video output is damn good from a small device connected it with my amazon fire stick im really satisfied with the purchase i will put a detailed review after a month however at first glance this product is worth for 6500 rupees you payi give 5 out of 5 star because resolution is 720p
4,superb am writing this after 2 months usage simply super product should go blindly never dissatisfiedokcan buy in in this price rangedelivery was fast but the product quality is just fine not very promisingissue the battery got struck into the remote though it is working fine for my sony d100 but i may have to either break the remote to take out the battery rest i think everything is fine at the priceexcellentworking superfirst remote i received was not working but seller replaced it and that is working fineprice is goodquality is also superthank you so much for selling this product with best price
4,affordable available and multi purpose cable best suitable for traveling and reducing overall cables to carrywarking fine build also goodit is a nice cable as it fits in most of the phones and devicessturdy one no fear of damage by wear and tearhowever i felt that the cable is heated up substantially with higher currentsthis uncommon in standard phone cables provided by oemsi have been using this cable from last few months and very much satisfied with the this product and i recommend to go for itthe cable quality is very good charging time is good with availability of different cable typesconsidering the price compared to competitors at market this is cheap but no compromises have been made with respect to sturdiness or quality the wires are wonderful despite using it for more over a month now no issues at all were faced regarding wire tangling torn out wires etc very sturdy and pretty easy to carryregarding charging speed it delivers what it promised the quality of the ports are also solid no issue had been faced at allpackaging was great performance of the product even greater the wires are long enough though in my personal opinion a little bit more lengthy would be icing on the cake making the product absolutely a perfect oneoverall very happy with purchasing it a great vfm product for all those having multiple type devices with them this one single cable has a solution to charging it allwarp charge is working fine and satisfactory lightning cable is working in normal condition rather than fats chargingbut overall the product is awesome and felt 100 value for moneylike
4,shown 2 pieces received only one also its not 6ft at all as mentioned did feel cheated charging is ok the reason i opted for this is just that i needed one iphone charger with usb portit is actually set of 2 three feet cables both working fine for me bought for emergency use and having no issues after a monthbought 2months back onlyproduct is goodnice and value for moneygood product but be prepared for long lead timemisleading title and descriptionits not 6ft cablebetter to use original itemjust bought it so not sure of durability or sturdiness but it was very cheap and so wasnt sure how good will it work but it works perfectly fine
4,my 32 inch tv fits fine also 55 inch tv can be wall mount for sure good product quality various sizes screws and nuts included in this productnice producti am giving 3 stars because screws provide in the product do not fit properly i had to get it separately to installi love to like its accuracy of fittingi had to makeshift the screws to fit the grill as the screws were long and had to add washer to make it fiti installed my selfit perfectly fit on my sony tv 32 inch stand is sturdy and good deducting 1 start as i dont see anything on the sides of the stand which can prevent my tv from falling on side so i had to little bit bend the sides of stand so that tv doesnt fall if someone pulls it from left or right otherwise its a good standnothing to write its a basic universal stand expensive here on amazon turns out the same thing was from 200 at a local hardware electroniclight store
3,the mouse feature of the remote is not workingremote control with push button seems to be ok but no voice recognition and no ray pointer as in the original lg productwould like a refund for misrepresentation on the websiteyou have amended the description after my complaintbest productnumber buttons are not workingdefective product it is not working with the tvdislike the product as it doesnt have pointer optionnot working properlybest option to buy since its hard to get replacement of oled tv remote
4,atlast i connected successfully working good but sound volume clarity not adequate durability to be assessed dear amazonin tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearlymanual printing also is bad i had to struggledoes what it says works well to connect two bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop smart tv etc can take a bit of time to pair two devices but the manual in the box helpssound quality over aux cable too is good so even if you do not have a digital output or rca you can still use it bit bit flimsy and delicate but then you dont need to move it around everydaydisadvantage the sound and video lag with distance while connecting bluetooth with headphonespairing with headphones difficult need to wait longfeels volumes lowi got this to addon to a highend system which traditionally doesnt have the facility however its often requested when guests come over i was using a phoenix transreceiver but the constant need of charging and the single indicator led made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application the optical out is connected to a dual ess9028 dac and the device used for transmission is the ipad airthis lacks a battery which is a big differentiator this means it is not exactly portable and the form factor reinforces that feature it is intended to be a desktop unit and it comes with a reasonable set of cables the quality of the included cables is quite poor so its best to use something elsecompared to the direct input from usb the overall sound is poorer with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble still this is being used in a highend system i suspect with many lesser speakerampdacs it will be acceptable at maximum output the level is about 12db lower than a direct usb connection to the dacit is around the same as my signature acoustics unit which is 13rd the size but uses a battery and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature or the nice display which is handy if you are close bythe bypass is one of the highlights of this device it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough and allows you to use both bt and another optical sourcereceiver though only either can be used at a timethe build quality is average it is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards hence the thin cables supplied the onboard volume control is nice if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume i use the dac remote it also has only 16 clicks so the control will be very coarse the display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low it is sufficient for the tasksoverall its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices the sound quality limitations of bt transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols so id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an addon for a hifi system for more normal usage there are cheaper options availableexcellent productbluetooth range is very lessbought it to connect my old sony 51 blueray home theater with mi 4k box which does not have optical sound port it has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in
4,tv is good in this price rangeits an excellent product for this price rangegoodpicture quality is goodamazing product sound quality is okay and smart features is little bit slow but its okay overall love this productok super workgood product
3,i have a pd supported car charger and i bought solimo cables previously which work perfectly fine but this one doesnt trigger full 3a fast charging unlike solimo usb a to usb c which is strange because this is supposed to be a 65w charger with 4a fast charging supportanyways its a good built product and works but not as expected it might be compatible with your chargers but i tested 2 different car chargers and both didnt go full speed
4,supergood quality value for money in time installedtv thik hai but vu ka customer support bhot bekar hai bacho se tv lock ho gya tha vu me call kia to kahne lage amazon me baat karo matlb tv ka lock amazon wale batenge amazon me baat ki to kahte hai vu me baat karo baad me maine hi kisi tarah uska lock khola but vu customer support bhot bekar hai vu ka smart tv thik haiin time delivery and proper installation at the time of delivery itself value for money for 32 tv requirement with branded productgood producttv is awesome one problem is casting whey you cast video from hotstar it comes black screen other than that picture and sound quality is awesomepicture quality just ok sharpness missingsound and speakers need lot of improvementsettings and menu can be optimised furtheroverall its a mid grade productpicture quality good as expected internet experience also good
4,a good productgot this for old 40 inch lg tv which is heavier and thicker than current models has held so farstand is easy to install but price is too for this itemthe product is very goodfits perfectlya little bit over pricedit worked like a charm handles my 65 inch panasonic tv well easy to assemblei returned it because of not fitting to my tv thats whynice productserves the purpose but one should be careful around the stand base is not wide enough for good balance small push or touch will result in a fall we have to be very careful while cleaning around

4,despite being affordable these headphones are pretty good i use them mostly for talking on the phone the sound quality is crisp and clear though for serious music listening i think other more expensive headphones will be betterworth to buy sound is also goodhttpsmmediaamazoncomimagesi61eznrj0dwlsy88jpgthe delivery was so fast the headphones are awesome sound quality is goodcalling is also nicebut i like most of this earphone its softness thanks to realme and amazoneit was good and delivered at the timehighly recommended
4,the selfie stick is made up of cheap quality plastichowever the built structure of the selfie stick is stable and even the tripod stand will provide you ample support to make a video time lapse or a portrait selfierecommended to all video bloggers who have just started their channels on youtube or any other sitesits worth a product with the money we are paying to purchase itdid take this product on a trip its good but i was always afraid whether its going to fell from the stand the holder is clumpsy cannot hold it tighter need another person help to insert the phone in the stand or need to sit down and stretch the phone holder to insert the phone maybe not worth 399 let me know if you have any other doubtsit is user friendlyproduct is good and light weightworks well and bluetooth connectivity is also goodnice productbluetooth option is goodstability is ok only otherwise a decent productgood product
4,the earphones have good clear sound quality it lacks base battery backup is good anc is a myth in this earphone it might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your eareat easily fit in ears and light weight and sound quality is good too over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile toobought this solely due to its form factor to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style to be true samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique twsthis is not an inear style tws but resembles somewhat earbud style tws only of its kind in the market as far as my knowledge goesthey are held very good in my ears gives me a good seal and does not fall out strange as i cant use earbuds because they fall out frequently it seems that samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework however it doesnt mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globethe finish build and all such generic factors are top notch the size of the buds and the case is very smallnow about the sound if the buds fit in ones ears with a good seal the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect it may be tinnythe sound signature is very bassy for my taste and i have to eq it to my taste the bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble i listen it in treble boost mode adjusted through the app anc works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable in contrary anc on somewhat opens up the sound dont buy this for ancstrangely to me these buds sound better on my iphone 12mini than my galaxy s22 spotify and apple music the buds have app support for both android galaxy wear and ios galaxy buds live but the android app is more feature packed and works better the ios app couldnt update the firmware although there is a menu in the app and always showed the device to be on latest firmware however as soon as i connected with my s22 on pairing the first thing it did was to update the firmwarei love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 44k against an mrp of 16k the do sound very good but does not suit my taste persons loving bass may love them dont get them for anc battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok it has wireless charging too if your ears are too small or too large than normal better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper sealbest call quality noise cancelling could have been improved to best but still wotks gooddescent battery lifemusic is good not to that top notch but good in this segmentoverall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but goodi am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its pricebluetooth range is not that goodthe sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat i got these for rs5290 it almost felt like a steal deal for me until i faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds the bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance it feels like i am using bluetooth v30 the range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket the audio starts stuttering the mic quality is a hit or miss inside the house it works very well but outside it performs poorly i think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphones quality if you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault i pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product even at rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue it is better to buy a wired iem atleast it will sound better than thisin this price samsung brand is goodeasy to wear and good battery backuphardly support the 2 meter bluetooth connectivity
4,very nice product and easy to use as well as very soft to cablein picture shows as 16 nos but in cover only 8 noseasy to attach with usb cable bought total 12 pieces in rs99 loved it quality productso far ok will hold the wire connecting after the usb joints but couldnt stop it from bendingdont even think of buying this by just looking at the cheap price of this product as it has been made by cheap quality plastic which can not protect your cables as it is not at all sturdy so please dont buyonly two packs camethe product is cool value for money love it

4,note its ready to go mic which doesnt need any sound card and can be plugged and used directly even with smartphones has 35mm jack connector built in you can use 14 connector if needed it has very long cable which measures upto 20 feet so note that it has absolutely no noise isolation and normal smartphone earphones does better job of noise reduction compared to them in stock condition but with simple editing this mic works just fine check the review below for detailed settings there are literally thousands of review on this product but none explained the best possible settings for it when used with smartphone with audacity software or even in general so i took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones so i went to search for best settings on amazon other sources but in vain fortunately i myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just finefirst i am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that i found and then listing those settingspros 1 built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given2 length of cable is insane 20 feet i personally didnt find it useful as i use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with camera3 has universal 35mm jack which is handy4 its easy to use just plug and play device which doesnt need any sound card or external device to work5 has support for multiple device right from smartphones to dslrs and computers6 it comes with carry pouch which is very handy since its a mess with such long cablescons 1 biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box its just garbage quality and even normal ears cant bear the background noise collection so forget about audiophiles my normal smartphones earphones record much better sound quality compared to this2 length of cable is way too much for me and i guess for many users i think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable3 it comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and theres no way to know whether the battery is dead or whats its charging level only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test so if you are carrying it with recorder which doesnt has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me its very frustrating i am mentioning it as this scenario have happened with me once hence i am very cautious about batteries now use it with smartphones or digital recorders4 i think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less considering the sound qualitybest setting using audacity software these are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use audacity software which is free 1 open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic2 select entire audio clip and open effects and then distortion 3 start the playback of audio clip in the software so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make4now select distortion type option on the top of box and select soft clipping or select hard limiter and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you5 take the clipping level cursor to extreme right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output6 adjust the makeup gain cursor little bit if needed i keep it on 49 here you can select which ever type which you feel is suitable for you7 now just click apply 8 now is noise reduction for that select short section of audio which does not have your voice but only has background noises that you dont want9 open effects and then noise reduction 10 click on get noise profile11 now select entire audio clip and again open effects and then noise reduction 12 finally click on ok and thats it now you are good to go with soft slightly lesser noises and more pleasant sound output after these steps you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user softwareverdict i personally am very disappointed with the sound quality though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level but its satisfactory enough plus price seems slightly more on this i wouldnt recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment buy this only if you live in very silent conditionsits not great or best out there for beginners but goodi use a budget midrange phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone record it in wav format its goodyou gotta use softwareapps to pull the best of this like audacity or some other editing appits pretty long and thats good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripodoverall its decent for beginners i see highend phones have good recording capabilities but if you have a budget phone then this one is dealmicrophone looks very well built it supports both phones and cameras there are some phones that does not support external mic please check before buying as one of my phone did not support itthey claim noise cancellation however i did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone i could not observe noise cancellation at least while recording on phoneoverall package is well bundled wire quality is decent however the dongle quality is excellent even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solidwire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then 5 stars from me but now 4 star good sound low price 1 star for wire quality but over all a nice producti think its good for online teaching like i dobut yeah some problems like very long cable length i mean someone might need but it should be optional or detachable price of the mic itself is not much anywaysi am okay with this mic for sometime until i am sure i need quality rode mic to upgradedont expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very goodnice productdecent

4,it is working as expected so farno complaintsgododthe product is definitely worth the price and keeps the laptop super cool i am not a gamer and this review is not for a gaming pc its very convenient for my office work the cooling pad has an additional usb and it helps in case an additional usb port is required when using the cooling padnot in mostly usegood productbut fan speed is little slowi tried it on my gaming and office laptopthere was 0 difference in temperatures on gaming laptopoffice laptop 14 hp core i5 8th gen did feel slightly cool to touch with the cooling pad but its ergonomics arent greatbut its value for money the two fans offer very little airflow and audible noise in wintersbody is sturdy enough but the laptop slips from the top grilland when you use the non slip clips on the front they come in the way of your hands while working on the laptopyour hand essentially rests on those clips and it hurtsdesign needs improvement and fans should have higher airflow accordingly a customer wouldnt mind slightly higher priceit is a decent product and economic in this price rangefan speed is decent for better speed give power from your chargernot recommended for high end performance laptopsa good product that keeps that decreases the laptop heat my dell vostro 3510 with 11th gen i3 would hover at around 60 65 c during regular use such as browsing movies youtube ps1 emulation etc but with this cooler the temps came down to 40 55 c during heavy gaming tested with fallout new vegas cpu 40 50 igpu 99 the laptop heated up as if there was no cooling pad but the laptop surface felt cooler please note that i live in a hill station and the climate is generally cool so your experience may be different i have not tested this with a gaming laptop
4,can buy but only when price is lessits not tht oomph feel to writeconsidering the name parker its like regular ball pensrather can tell the ink is too dull compared to other ball penslot of money taken under the name parkerits the worth of 20i thought parker would be good compared to the lousy pen its uncomfortable i dont use it at allmoneywise goodi use parker pen because it runs finethe pen has a black body but blue jotter refill in it the blue jotter writes awfully the ink flow has reduced over timeim using this from last 3 years im happy with the productnice packaging quality look
4,the product doesnt feel premium i would say its a good product given the priceable to hold all your individual wires and hard disk etcbecomes too tight if mobile charger and charging bank are placedi keep my small gadgets and cables organized inside my bag could be better if it had more space for at least small boxes adapters etcgood product has quite a few compartments and can keep a lot of stuff has readjustable brackets in one the sections where items of varrying sizes can be stored has enough pockets to carry multiple pen drives and chargers inner padding is slightly foamy so it does provide decent drop protection if you are tight on budget go for itit does what it is meant for all your wires chargers are in one place you can go for it not that luxurious but at this price its definitely worth having it than loosing your wiresgoodquality of marerial
4,some keys could be better but in this budget its good enoughi use to play gta 5 and fifa and some car racing games which are so goodand vibration is so good in this budgetgood for this budgetthe product worked fine for 6 months but after that the start button and select button of the controller went inside and it became defective and it stopped working so i had to wait for weeks for the buttons to come back up and for it to work again since those two buttons are not crucial for playing the game it was manageable to some extenttbh its good if you are a amateur gamer its completely fine at this pricebut if you are hardcore gamer pro level then i will suggest you to pay a bit more and go for a better one because sometimes out of no reason some movements doesnt work when i play cricket suddenly in the middle of the match one shot selection doesnt work and it disrupts the momentum still its a decent product cant say about durability now will update few months laterless weight compared to other sticksthe l2 and r2 is little hard but still playablebattery backup is goodthe charging port is b thats not a good thing because we all are using c port chargersalthough for this price point its okayi have been using this for 3 weeks now and i saw no flaws with this one the l2 and r2 are a bit tight but other than that no issues i ruff use a lot when playing and this is very durable although it does not have markings for grip the grip is good too this one needed no extra installations and is a plug and play just what i neededdoesnt support all the time on windows 11 the device is not recognisable most of tge times and you just need to plug and unplug the thing continuously
4,a good distraction to keep kids away from devices overall a good buygood item fun to playlikean average writing padbrightness can be improve more and pen shape also can be changenice very good for kids easy to learn and quite educativevalue for money and good quality productvery nice and smooth easy to use and brightness is not very low nice product for kids to use
4,good product under 800it has 3 pots for mic headphone and usb for led glow you will require a splitter for laptopgreat product for online tutors as i also purchased for the same try this product if looking for budget headphone for cpu for gaming and online classesvery decent headphones the mic is also very good durability needs time to tell the last redgear lasted about 2 yearsits so comfortable to weari have even tried the cosmic byte gs430 from the same price range though i find these pair to be more value for moneycomfort they are comfortable the earcups are very soft and recommended if you do gaming for longer periods of timedesign the design is actually pretty good considering the price rangemic the microphones quality is actually great considering the priceconnectivity recommended if your pclaptop has a seperate mic and sound jack you have to buy a splitter if you want to use the mic on a mobile what ive noticed with other headsets is they provide a single jack for sound and mic output but these come with 2 jacks so thats a plus pointsound quality these pair of headphones are only recommended for casual gaming and media consumption the sound quality while gaming is fine although it doesnt have that 71 sound but still i was able to figure out the footsteps i also use the windows sonic for headphones and that helps toohowever at this price dont expect a good sound quality if you listen to music the max volume feels low and the bass is almost non existent the treble highs and lows are done fine but buy these pair only if your priority is gaming and you are at a budgetsee the headphones are good if u are purchasing in 500to 600 but let me tell u dont have good surround sound mic volume is too low you cant increase it and no bassthe headset is overall good its sound quality and build quality is appreciated at the same time i have a few concerns first of all it gives a lot of pressure on both ears so after an hour it starts hurting my laptop has one input for audio this has two so you have to buy an extra pin to connect it otherwise go for itthis headphone is to good in low price noise cancellation is working properly also u can adjust volume as your choice im using this headphone for my live stream1 problem if your head is big it will fit properly otherwise movingthis product is decent base is low but it is good in the given price range

4,i am writting this after 4months usuage go for it as suction power is too good only cons is dust capacity is very limited as we need to clean frequentlyits too heavy to be handle and not good for deep cleaning i tried to clean matresses and sofa but dusts were theretoo early to write the review but working good so farlikes handy easy to use comparatively light cleans extremely well due to strong suction power looks good good clean design power cord is very long easy to store doesnt take up much spacedislikes heated up quite a lot within 2 minutes not even 5 minutes after cleaning an upholstered stool and foot rug had to switch off and let it cool so obviously not something that can be used at a stretch to clean all your upholstery etc like othermore expensive vacuum cleaners no flexible hose with the more expensive version with extension stick when one has paid much more providing the small flexible hose which is meant for cleaning inaccessible areas like underneath sofas ceilings etc was something i expected im sure the hose itself is pretty inexpensive they could easily have provided it at no extra cost if one needs that hose one needs to buy the less expensive unit again just to get the hose as its not even available for sale separately manual is hopelessly inadequate had to look up youtube videos no soft brush provided for cleaning the filter does not come in amazon packaging even though its fulfilled by amazon its just the agaro box think is closed by openable flaps not even sealed so we cannot be sure if its a returned defective product or brand new one no quality check sticker or anything assuring that the product has been checked before packing on a youtube video there was a sticker at the joint of dust connector and main body on mine there is no sticker just slight sticky residue so its been removed by someone not sure if its a returned product again as there is no seals on the box i dont want to return this as i already had returned one box that was filthy with oil stains and had opened from the bottom flaps had come apart none of the attachments etc were sealed in their plastic cover packets quite loud reading the reviews i thought it would be less noisy but its not no blower function other brands in this range have would have been great to have this only 3 attachments floor carpet brush multipurpose brush crevice nozzle other brands in this range have many more an extra filter would have been a good gesture to include not very light if one wants to clean high surfaces like sides of ceiling or ceiling fans etc one needs to lift it and hold in hand while cleaning very difficult to do especially for ladies or at least me a middleaged lady again here the flexible hose if provided would have been handy someone could hold the vacuum cleaner while using the hose to clean high areasall in all reasonably happy with this purchase as it is a supplementary one to my existing 35 year old eureka forbes vacuum cleaner which is still going strong as the upholstery cleaning attachments for that model got losti do feel strongly though that the price could have been reduced considering all the above pros and conscompact sizeit is a light duty light usage and a limited application area equipment not for effective complete usageits a good vaccum good suction and easy to clean up however the suction sound is quite loud nevertheless its a good machine does the job wellthe product works well it just heats up after using for 15mins

4,useful for dark colour n delicate dresswhat an amazing product was quite sceptical before buying it after reading all these mixed reviews but glad i didsmoothens out the creases from dresses coats woollens and any fabric which is otherwise non ironable of course you cant expect it to crease out the cotton shirts but it is a very handy product especially if you are travelling also the steam sanitises the clothes making them odour freethe water tank is small and needs to be refilled again after about 2 clothes but bigger tank would have made it heavy and difficult to operateoverall good purchaseloving this product while usingit does the job pretty wellthe cons according to me are 1 you cannot use it with clothes placed on horizontal flat surfaces because the water doesnt reach the outlet in the tank if the tank is half empty the alternative is that the dress has to be hanged to a cloth hanger and then use the steamer2 be careful while steaming as it may burn the skin keep you palm at a safe distance while steaming the dress this may be an issue when you try to steam the sleeves of the garment and also for flowing dresses3 not all fabrics can be completely wrinkle free4 it sometimes leaves more steam and water at times leaving your garment with wet patches the garment feels wet after using the steamer5 you have to keep filling the tank twice for using it on one topeasy to use sturdy and does the job only thing is that it takes time to cool rest of all goodits an amazing product and easy to use just hang the cloth somewhere and start using thisgreat producteasy to carryfoldableand results greatan average product but the cost is too high as it doesnt completely satisfy your purpose

4,takes space and not convenient if in a hurry the handheld model would be better suited and more useful for frequent usei used this product once after reading the manual the first impression after using it on 3 cotton shirts without starch and one pant is pathetic none of the shirts got wrinkle free on full steam hence you could guess what it would be in trouserslater i found it is satisfactory on silk nylon shirts t shirts etc but none will get an iron effect wrinkle will be there in small amount and a slight wet feel when the steam cool down but it will go if fastit is mainly useful for ladies who wear embroidered nylon silk materials stone work fabrics etc etc men who use t shirts and nylon rich trousers otherwise dont even think of buying it in my case i use cotton whites and white trousers mainly at office as i am a lawyer hence for me it is totally useless no females at home and hence it is another product that grab my home spaceregarding comfort while using it i would say i am totally disappointed as the board behind it is not much of use while using g shirt because of its size which is not that long the last two button downwards will always hard to press it to board and we have to take the hanger hold high on one hand and thus another difficult part as the nylon material needs another hands to hold it firm secondly the long full sleeves are totally difficult to do it though steam is applied the wrinkles wont go easily add we are not pressing it to board and it will always go here and there the top stand is a hanger shaped but the clips attached as useless as the board comes in between for trousers the product itself wont work good so if we use the hanger it comes with you need to put the switch off place the handle in slot take the shirt out and then only we can use the back side to steam after waiting again to steam up switch on etc otherwise steam will go on coming out of itany way the product is more useful that those similar without a pressing boardthe next negative thing is manual says for better lasting of product and to avoid decalcification the water after use should be drained and cleaned hence it means you cant use it daily morning in rush while going to office that needs little time at the same time you cant press all dress in a stretch and cant fold it like we do with iron box it wont work that away so if you have long large cupboard with hangers as in mansions you can try thatin effect buy it if you find exceptions and usages apart from what i mentioned aboveps i am seriously thinking of olx received a broked packedge with broken itemi thought it would make my task of ironing easy but its useless on cottons and silks its great to use it on chiffon and polyester do not buy thinking you wont need standard ironing anymoreit is fantastic for marriages where there are many dresses net based where you cant use iron quick good for suitsit looks like an imitation product pieces dont match properly and some look very weakvalu ed for moneyits not effective and pressing clothes effectively seems to have an issue
4,product and service reviewbuying price 8999 during prime day sale with 10 discount from hdfc debit cardproduct reviewrating 45this is a new model launched during prime day from eureka forbes aquaguard line of products named aquasure delightthe product is pleasant to look and comes with a capacity of 75l on paper but holds only 7 liters of water equipped with reverse osmosis ultraviolet radiation lamp and manual adjustment for total dissolved solidscan be manually adjusted only by service engineer the 7 liter tank fills at about 30 mins but the water wastage is very high for every 1litre water purified there is a drainage of 115 litre from the drain pipe please collect the water and reuse it for washing utensils or bathing shaving or watering plants the drained water is same as tank water just with higher tds the water taste varies according to the level of tds you choose very low tds will give a good taste to water but at a loss of the mineral content of water which i will not recommend the default tds after purification is set somewhere between 80100 drinking water should have tds below 300manufacturer reviewrating 251the manufacturer of this product is eureka forbes i am giving a rate of 25 because the product that is now installed at my home is a replaced product because the first product that i received was a defective one the drain pipe would not stop draining water even when the tank was full i asked the technician to check it and he said the valve is defective so i received a defective product out of the box i ordered for a replacement on amazon which they processed and i got another one in which the led lights were displaced i dont know it happened during transport or it is some manufacturing defect i would have been disappointed for the second time but i observed it and reported to the technician who replaced the led lights to their original position so that the led indicators were now visible outside the replaced products valve is functional and now operating without any hassleservice review05dont expect to have a very comfortable installation experience its going to be a heartache the reasons are1 the people eureka forbes has employed as technicians are thieves i am saying this because aquasure delight comes with integrated diverter valve this is a stainless steel structure that is fitted to water outlet coming from the wall so that it can act as converter to be joined to the aquaguard inlet as i hadnt opened the package when it arrived because some or many of the companies void the warranty of you open the box containing the product mostly electrical items that need installation like tvs washing machines taking the precaution i didnt open the box so i was unaware that diverter is included in the package the technician after fitting the diverter charged rs 200 saying that he fitted that from his side and diverter is not included in the package i came to know this when i opened the package of the replaced product and found the diverter included along and confronted him but he defended saying some purifiers have diverter in them and some dont i still have to confirm this with eureka forbes2 the pre filter doesnt come included in the package so the technicians sell it to you at higher prices my technician sold it to me at rs 950 which is available at amazon at rs 750 but then if had ordered it from amazon i have to install it by myself i dont have a drill etc so i had to pay him rs 950 so loss of rs 400 on the technician my opinion on this is that eureka forbes should sell water purifiera with pre filter even though it raises the cost of the product by rs 700 to rs 800platform review25the platform in which i bought is of course amazon i am giving it a rating of 25 because i received a defective product the first time and amazon refused to replace it because installation request was not raised by amazon amazon never raises an installation request unlike flipkart which raises an installation request from its side which actually makes your life easy as in case if you receive a defective product which you notice after installation flipkart directly consults with the technician and may even resend him to verify the authenticity of the problem for installation you have to call the eureka forbes toll free number and raise an installation request so amazon representative was demanding an installation report a video or photo proof of the problem now how could i make that thief of a technician to write an installation report and about taking a photo or video i got the water purifier uninstalled as soon as i found it defective to put it up for replacement but i didnt know replacement request has these many hassles as it was my first time replacing an electronic productsummary1 product is good for the mentioned price2aquasure comes with integrated diverter valve a stainless steel device that is attached to your water outlet and the aquaguard dont let your technician charge you for it3 the technician will overcharge you for pre filter be ready for that4 technicians are cunning and mostly thieves so be sharp around them5 make sure product is not defective if it is amazon is going to give you a hard time replacing it6 amazon will not raise an installation request you have to raise it by yourself by calling eureka forbes customer careoverall verdict 255if your family in 4 members you have choice eureka forbes delight rouvtds this product is very effective and efficient agua guard provides installation with in 24 hours of delivery before the installation had tds level is 125 and after the installation had tds level is 62 nice product by aquaguard water taste is also sweetthis is very good water purifier but i see service guy for installation seems in hurry he just installed and went off he did not show how much is tds how to adjust it dont buy this product on amazon buy it from local stores if possiblei purchased this product on a heavy festival discount there was problem initially after installation due to defective water holding knob i reported this issue and immediately replacement was arranged although i had to wait for about two weeks the serviceman came and installed another piece since then it is working excellently in all the best part was that the services were good and responsiveamazon part of the business was smoothdelivery done within timelines payments exchange cashback all done hassle freeeureka forbes another storyfor installation i had to call them daily for 7 daysfinally on escalation and on hold with eureka forbes customer service for close to 90 minutes installation was doneeureka forbes now calls me every other day to force this reviewmy main reason for writing this reviewi got the purifier installed and before that i was having bislery water reason why i have so many bottles which thankful came handy the deliver and installation was smooth after installation the agent mentioned to let the filter fill up completely and then throw away all the 1st batch of filtered water since its the 1st time filteration process so it will basically clense it overallso i decided to let it full up and once it was full i turned off the switch so no more whater comes in i used the empty 2l bislery bottles to fill up the 1st batch of filtered water which as shown in the image which is around 6l as mentioned by the companyafter i emptied the filter to its last drop i turned on the filter with another set of empty bottles at the waste pipe side it took quite a while to fill up the tank fully but as it did it filled up almost 132 l worth of bottles as seen in the image this is roughly 220 or more than twice the amount of filtered waternow the company claims 60 water saved in comparison to other rouv filters and i have no knowledge of how much water wastage they do but i think its a bit much regardlessfir every 6l of purified water it wastes 13lmy tal water tds is 470filtered water tds is 86and the waste water tds is 640maybe its because of the tds levels due to which it wastes as much water ky does and its possible that the amount might vary for different tds levels at sourcebut i recommend to have the waste water collected and used for something else if possible rather than just letting it drain down 13l almost everyday wasted is 390l per month and this is considering you only filter 6l of water per dayill redo this once more to see if theres any difference in values this is juts to keep the potential buyers informedi like speed to fill water n less wastage i like tds adjuster and easy to install i dont like internal plastic body though i believe its steel need confirmation overall good product we are satisfied having it installed from 34 weeksdeserve a 5 star on product however ran into a problem when it comes to installation the technicians of the servicing centre at my local area gave me a huge problem by delaying the installation at last one technician came forward
4,this is aesthetically the most appealing digital kitchen scale out of the available choices though it is also by far the most expensive it is value for money considering the followig pros1 functionality it has only two touch buttons which integrate all the functions like units of weight volume multiple tare weigh with overload indication and offon it can give volume idications for water and milk two of the most frequently used liquids while other liquids can be also measured if a glass of water is calibrated for a certain volume say 100 ml ad same is marked on the glass the plastic food grade bowl fits snugly on the scale and also doubles up as a cover when the scale is not in use2 duraility because of its squat oblong shape and sure footing the scale wont topple also since bowl fits snugly on the scale upside down when the scale is not being used it prevents dust from entering the display and buttons material is tough plastic with a recessed top which seats the bowl firmly and there is no exposed space for ingress of any spilt liquid with all this theres a one year warranty extendable to two years which speaks about the confidence of the manufacturers in their own design3 battery life the device has an auto power off and a digital display which consumes very less power hence battery is likely to last longeri only encountered two cons1 scale is very sensitive and takes some time to settle2 the display backlight goes away after some time and the lcd reading is difficult to read in bright ambient lightoverall this device serves my purpose of practical diet management very efficiently and effectively and am sure it will grow on me recommended if you want to get much more utility and eficiency at a slightly higher pricelitt to adjust all timeok price wise it didnt last long

3,hi viewers so i bought this product after watching the endless hauls of amazonfinds as much as i was excited for the use of the product it did not prove to be as useful the sealing side does not heat enough for a packet to be sealed well the cutter side works fine but mostly the heating side has to be pressed upon so hard that the cell case opens up as it slides with the pressure of the thumb so i feel we can totally work without this product in our house its definitely stylish comes with a manual cells and a hook to hang it but the slipping cell cover fails my convinience with itgudeasy to use worth the moneywhen we press to seal lower part get open automaticallynot heating enamous power to heat and pack the plastic coverquality of the product is not good the hold and press part for heating and sealing is not consistent sometimes it seals sometimes it burns the plastic also the seal comes off of right pressure is applied so it is not reliable toothe sealer quality is too good and its sealing well the only thing is you hv to press it hard while sealingtakes only few seconds to seal an entire packet good when you are travelling with a toddler and carrying lots of snack packets pocket friendly and cuteaverage working

4,good servicegoodi like this producttaste is also good worth for money productoki am updating my review hope it will get published and the whos and who of the brand will pay attention to it after every two to three months the unit is having problem with the inlet system many a times the inlet stops taking water but the indicator shows tank filling it was rectified by the service person again now the indicator showing tank filling while the inlet valve is shut it should show the purple light means low or no pressure its a faulty unit the installation guy and the service persons were right who stated that the faulty and low quality units are sold online whose statement i ignored thinking that every offline seller says so alas i was wrong i want this unit to be removed immediately and want my hard earned money backat this price this product is very suitableesy to install

4,i have been using this geyser for almost two months it heats up the water in just 15 minutes and quite power efficient uses almost half a unit for two person and if you leave it on for the whole day its around 1 unit very power efficient and looks stylish in the bathroom and due to the form factor doest take much space go for it you get all the pipes and installation material in the box so no need to buy them separately which is the case in some other modelsi had 2 option while purchasing this geyser havells vs this one i opted this one as this was cheaper then its havells counterpart but this geyser does not satisfies me at all the only pros is its heats up water very quickly but rest is all consi keep the know to maximum temperature but still the light does not move from orange to red even if i put on the geyser for 3 hrs it does not holds hot water for long i have used recold ao smith even amica earlier they were not as quick as crompton but they used to hold hot water for long i have another havells at home whose light goes from green to orange to red to display water temperaturepaisa wasul haithe product is not that good just given 5 star energy efficient but it takes more time to heat the water also dont holds hot water for atleast 6 hrs temperature control also not so good after getting 23 liters itself water becomes cold even if it is on from 20 minim using ao smith geyser in our one room from five years no issue again purchased 2 geysers for other two rooms one is ao smith and other is this crompton even though i spend more for this geyser im not satisfied better go for ao smith or racoldwaranty card are missing 8 good product using since 2 months working properly

4,though i bought a pack of two after seeing the pictures and checking model i received only one compatible with my aquasure the other is different and not compatible with my unit so essentially my money for the other is wasted because the return window was overusing product regularlyeasy to installpoor quality doesnt stay more than 1 month its kinda duplicateit is available in 300 rs in csd but its not available there thats why we choose to buy it onlinebut its duplicate and very expensive hencenot satisfiedgive the address where we can buy it offlineonline also whats the warranty of this product mention itgoodits easy to useinstallation is difficult if you dont or cant understand the fitting procedure but once you do aokay and super easyimportant lasts me well over 3 months but i recommend changing it after you think the flow of water has slowed down a lot or you think the water tastes funnyfor the last few days of its life the water will not be completely pure and it wont completely stopthis filter has a good water flow rate for a family of four it disperses enough water fast within 30 minutes youll have several liters of water to drinkalso the main thing about this is it is chemical free it also filters out viruses take a look at who recommendation if you fold a cloth ten times over and pour water over it it can filter out cholera virusi would recommend this to all home owners since i got this cartridge delivery i didnt need to run to the storereally liked the product but amazon packing is really made me disappointed really broken a trust on amazon filter kits were completely separated from the box cause the external box was too small and made the filter kits squeeze completely i just pulled the filter kits to get its normal size please amazon dont do this kind of weird packing atleast pack in a approximate box not this kind of flat huge box thank you
4,i installed it myself in my kitchen and it is very usefulgoodheating of water good but water become so hot u cant put your hand in it if it mixes the cold or running water with the hot water it will be good or water temperature can be adjusted it will be greatthe product is very good easy to install and easy to use the water spray jet is also good with movebale outletwater comes out either hot 60 degree centigrade or cold same like your water tank temperaturei thought i will getting mixed water as there is no provision of controlling the temperature always the water is more hot that you even cannot put your hand and if you bring the knob towards cold it immediately cools down so it is either hot or cold not botheven if you slightly move the knob towards the hot side within 3 sec the temperature rises to 60degree centigrade from 30degree centigradewas expecting a reostat to control the temperaturenot able to use for the required purpose for kitchenpls do not purchase this items water does not get hot at all you reduce or increase water pressure its biggest weakness that there is no option to increase the temperature or last one its price totally worth lesswonderful product in this segment and value added product for home during winterthe water gets extremely hot when given in hot mode and quickly gets cold when cold water option is switchedideal should be like geyser it should have the option for both hot and cold water running parallelly so that a nice warm water flows and things get doneone cannot wash dishes with hand when water is very hot or very cold

4,purchased this last month its good as working fine for me size is bit small but you can easily toast 2 normal breads at one go just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side cord is bit small but its good if you have plug near your kitchen at first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you cant wash directly under tap you need to use clean cloth with wetted with water you can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grilloverall goodit is ok but does not look sturdy enoughthe top and lower heaters are not parallel if the sandwich is a little thicka little better design would have avoided this problemmakes the breads go crunchy from soft 1010 would recommendvery nice easy to use except there is no temperature control knob i like my sandwich more crisperquality is good and easy to use received in 24 hoursproduct is good i post review after 4 months from purchasesufficient for 3 to 4 family memberi suggest go iteasy to use and easy to cleannot bad at all2 issues1 the hook is on one side so if your sandwich is a bit bulky then the upper half may be tilted and loose on one side2 the hook is also flimsy so there is a risk of breaking
